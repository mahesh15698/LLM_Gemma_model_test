# Gemma Model Fine-Tuning Tutorial
## Overview
This repository contains a tutorial notebook demonstrating how to fine-tune Gemma models using KerasNLP with JAX backend. Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models developed by Google, designed to assist developers and researchers in building AI responsibly.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the following steps:

Setting up Gemma with JAX backend
Creating a Gemma model for text generation
Generating text responses using Gemma models
Fine-tuning Gemma models using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with the Databricks Dolly 15k dataset
Performing inference before and after fine-tuning
## Notebook Details
GemmaLLMExample&setup.ipynb: This notebook serves as the tutorial guide, providing step-by-step instructions on setting up Gemma, creating a model, generating text, and fine-tuning the model using LoRA.
## Usage
To use this tutorial notebook:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the notebook GemmaLLMExample&setup.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google Colab.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to set up Gemma, create and fine-tune the model, and perform text generation.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Google Colab
Libraries: Keras 3, KerasNLP, JAX
